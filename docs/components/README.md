## Component Architecture

The Grimoire uses a modular component architecture that prioritizes:

- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused throughout the application
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Accessibility**: Components are built with accessibility in mind
- **Performance**: Components are optimized for performance

Components are implemented in TypeScript and follow consistent patterns for state management, event handling, and styling.
