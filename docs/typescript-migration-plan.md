# TypeScript Migration Plan - Remaining Work

This document outlines the plan for completing the TypeScript migration for the Steam Deck DUB Edition project. We've made significant progress, but there are still several components that need to be migrated.

## Overview

Current Progress: 64.4%

We've successfully migrated:
- Test infrastructure and test files
- Service Worker
- API Integration
- State Management
- Router

## Priority Order for Remaining Work

We'll tackle the remaining work in the following order:

1. **Core Files** - These form the foundation of the application
2. **Services** - These provide functionality to the rest of the application
3. **Utils** - Utility functions used throughout the codebase
4. **Components** - UI components that can be migrated last

## Detailed Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Files (Week 1)

| File | Complexity | Dependencies | Notes |
|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| main.js | Medium | - | Application entry point |
| app-initialization.js | Medium | core/index.ts | Already migrated |
| font-loader.js | Low | - | Simple utility for loading fonts |
| electron-main.js | High | - | Electron-specific code |
| renderer.js | Medium | - | Rendering logic |
| layout.js | Medium | - | Layout management |
| ui-improvements.js | Medium | - | UI enhancements |
| ui-main.js | High | - | Main UI code |

**Approach**: Create TypeScript interfaces for each module first, then migrate the implementation.

### Phase 2: Services (Week 2)

| File | Complexity | Dependencies | Notes |
|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| settings.js | Medium | state/store.ts | Uses the state management system |
| preload.js | Low | - | Electron preload script |
| search.js | High | - | Search functionality |
| pdf-export.js | Medium | - | PDF export capability |
| content-loader.js | High | - | Content loading and caching |
| progress-tracker.js | Medium | state/store.ts | Tracks user progress |
| offline.js | Medium | service-worker.ts | Offline functionality |

**Approach**: Create service interfaces, then implement concrete implementations.

### Phase 3: Utils (Week 3)

| File | Complexity | Dependencies | Notes |
|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| cleanup.js | Low | - | Resource cleanup functions |
| lazy-loader.js | Medium | - | Lazy loading of resources |
| search.js | High | services/search.ts | Search utilities |
| print-helper.js | Low | - | Print functionality |
| accessibility-ui.js | Medium | - | Accessibility UI helpers |
| layout-utilities.js | Medium | - | Layout utility functions |
| debug-helper.js | Low | - | Debugging utilities |

**Approach**: Create utility function signatures with proper types.

### Phase 4: Components (Week 4)

| File | Complexity | Dependencies | Notes |
|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| preferences.js | High | state/store.ts | User preferences component |
| navigation.js | Medium | - | Navigation component |
| sidebar.js | Medium | - | Sidebar component |
| index.js | Low | - | Component exports |
| version-display.js | Low | - | Version display component |
| progress-tracker.js | Medium | services/progress-tracker.ts | Progress UI component |
| code-blocks.js | Medium | - | Code highlighting component |
| gallery.js | Medium | - | Image gallery component |

**Approach**: Create component interfaces and convert to TypeScript.

## Type Definition Strategy

For each module, we'll follow this process:

1. Create type definitions (.d.ts files) for the module
2. Convert implementations to TypeScript
3. Update imports/exports for other modules
4. Add tests to verify type safety

## Testing Strategy

Each migrated module will need:

1. Unit tests to verify functionality
2. Type safety tests to ensure proper typing

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Maintain backward compatibility during migration |
| Complex interdependencies | Map dependencies before migration |
| Electron integration | Create proper TypeScript types for Electron API |
| Browser compatibility | Test in multiple environments |

## Completion Criteria

The TypeScript migration will be complete when:

1. All JavaScript files are converted to TypeScript
2. All type definitions are created and used consistently
3. Tests pass with no type errors
4. Build process successfully compiles TypeScript code
5. Application functions correctly in all environments

## Additional Documentation

We'll need to update these documentation files:

1. README.md - Update with TypeScript info
2. CONTRIBUTING.md - Add TypeScript contribution guidelines
3. docs/components.md - Update with TypeScript component examples
