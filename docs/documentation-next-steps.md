# Documentation Reorganization - Next Steps

We've started reorganizing the documentation for the Steam Deck DUB Edition project to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. Here are the next steps to complete the reorganization.

## Completed So Far

- ✅ Created documentation directory structure
- ✅ Created placeholder README files for each directory
- ✅ Created core documentation files:
  - GETTING-STARTED.md
  - ARCHITECTURE.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
- ✅ Created sample guide: CODING-STANDARDS.md
- ✅ Created sample feature documentation: TYPESCRIPT.md
- ✅ Created main documentation index

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Complete Core Documentation

1. Complete existing placeholder documents:
   - [ ] Create LAYOUT-GUIDELINES.md in guides directory
   - [ ] Create TESTING-GUIDELINES.md in guides directory
   - [ ] Create OFFLINE-SUPPORT.md in features directory

2. Move and adapt existing content:
   - [ ] Review implementation-plan.md and migrate relevant parts to ARCHITECTURE.md
   - [ ] Review CSS-GUIDELINES.md and ensure content is included in CODING-STANDARDS.md
   - [ ] Review testing.md and test-migration.md and consolidate into TESTING-GUIDELINES.md

### Phase 2: Create Report Documents

1. Create report templates:
   - [ ] Create PERFORMANCE.md from performance-optimizations.md
   - [ ] Create ACCESSIBILITY.md from accessibility-report.md
   - [ ] Create ERROR-HANDLING.md from error-handling-report.md
   - [ ] Create MIGRATION-PROGRESS.md to track migration efforts

### Phase 3: Components Documentation

1. Create component documentation:
   - [ ] Create COMPONENT-CATALOG.md by consolidating components.md and component-visuals.md
   - [ ] Ensure all components are properly documented with examples

### Phase 4: Clean Up Old Documentation

1. Archive or remove outdated files:
   - [ ] Archive files that have been fully migrated to the new structure
   - [ ] Update any references to old files in code or documentation

2. Update cross-references:
   - [ ] Update links between documentation files
   - [ ] Ensure consistent navigation between documents

### Phase 5: Final Improvements

1. Documentation Quality:
   - [ ] Review all documentation for consistency in style and format
   - [ ] Add diagrams and visual aids where needed
   - [ ] Fix any broken links or references

2. User Testing:
   - [ ] Have team members navigate the documentation to find specific information
   - [ ] Gather feedback on usability and completeness

| migration-guide.md | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| code-review-plan.md | CONTRIBUTING.md |
| CSS-GUIDELINES.md | guides/CODING-STANDARDS.md |
| layout-guide.md | guides/LAYOUT-GUIDELINES.md |
| testing.md | guides/TESTING-GUIDELINES.md |
| test-migration.md | guides/TESTING-GUIDELINES.md |
| components.md | components/COMPONENT-CATALOG.md |

## Automation Opportunities

To speed up the reorganization process, consider creating scripts to:

1. Extract sections from existing documents
2. Generate new documents based on templates
3. Update cross-references automatically
4. Check for broken links

## Timeline

1. Phase 1 (Complete Core Documentation): 1-2 days
2. Phase 2 (Create Report Documents): 1-2 days
3. Phase 3 (Components Documentation): 2-3 days
4. Phase 4 (Clean Up Old Documentation): 1 day
5. Phase 5 (Final Improvements): 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 6-10 days of focused effort
