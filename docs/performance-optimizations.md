# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in Grimoire to ensure a smooth, responsive user experience across various devices.

## Performance Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics Tracking**: Implemented in `performance-monitor.js` to track key metrics like First Contentful Paint, DOM Interactive, and resource load times.
- **Long Task Detection**: Automatically detects and logs tasks that take more than 16ms (60fps frame budget).
- **Function Execution Measurement**: Wraps critical functions to measure and log execution time when they exceed performance thresholds.

## Resource Optimization

### Image Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they enter (or approach) the viewport.
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically generates and uses appropriately sized images based on viewport and device.
- **Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP)**: Implements the blur-up technique for a better loading experience.
- **Native Lazy Loading**: Uses the browser's built-in lazy loading when available.
- **Critical Image Preloading**: Preloads essential images needed for the initial rendering.

### Caching Strategies

- **In-Memory LRU Cache**: Implements a Least Recently Used cache for frequently accessed content.
- **Service Worker Cache**: Utilizes the Cache API for offline access and faster repeat visits.
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Serves cached content first for faster page loads, then updates from the network.
- **Component HTML Caching**: Caches rendered component HTML to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## DOM Performance

- **Minimizing Layout Thrashing**: Batches DOM reads and writes to prevent forced reflows.
- **Virtual DOM-like Approach**: Only renders visible items for long lists (virtual scrolling).
- **Document Fragment Usage**: Batches DOM insertions using DocumentFragments.
- **Throttled Scroll and Resize Handlers**: Limits the frequency of expensive event handlers.
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Uses passive event listeners for touch and scroll events.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Manages CSS transitions for smoother UI updates.

## Code Efficiency

- **Debouncing and Throttling**: Applied to expensive operations like search and scroll handling.
- **Event Delegation**: Uses event bubbling to reduce the number of event listeners.
- **Idle Time Processing**: Defers non-critical operations to browser idle periods.
- **ResizeObserver**: Uses ResizeObserver instead of window resize events where appropriate.
- **Intersection Observer**: Monitors element visibility without scroll events.

## Loading Performance

- **Code Splitting**: Breaks JavaScript into smaller chunks loaded on demand.
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Dynamically imports components when they're needed.
- **Critical CSS Inlining**: Includes only essential CSS for initial rendering.
- **Asset Preloading**: Preloads critical assets for faster rendering.
- **Background Processing**: Uses Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks.

## Best Practices

- **Optimal JavaScript Patterns**: Avoids memory leaks and unnecessary object creation.
- **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Simplifies animations for low-power devices.
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user preference for reduced motion.
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent network requests to avoid overwhelming the browser.
- **Cached Computations**: Stores results of expensive calculations.

## Browser Support

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all browsers, enhanced features on modern browsers.
- **Polyfills**: Selectively loaded for older browsers.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler implementations when modern APIs aren't available.

## Monitoring and Ongoing Optimization

- **Metrics Logging**: Records performance data for analysis.
- **Render Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies UI components that cause performance issues.
- **Resource Size Monitoring**: Tracks bundle sizes and resource footprints.

These optimizations collectively provide a responsive, efficient application experience while minimizing resource usage and maximizing compatibility across devices.
