# TypeScript Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan and progress for migrating the Steam Deck DUB Edition project to TypeScript.

## Goals

- Improve code quality and maintainability through static typing
- Reduce runtime errors through compile-time type checking
- Enhance developer experience with better tooling and autocompletion
- Establish a foundation for more robust state management and future features

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow a progressive approach:

1. **Setup & Infrastructure** ✅
   - Install TypeScript and necessary dependencies
   - Configure TypeScript compiler options
   - Create core type definitions
   - Update build pipeline to handle TypeScript files

2. **Type Definition Phase** ✅
   - Create interface definitions for major components
   - Define types for core application state
   - Create type definitions for API responses and requests
   - Define utility types and common patterns

3. **Component Migration Phase** ❌
   - Convert React components from `.jsx` to `.tsx`
   - Apply appropriate interface and prop types
   - Fix any type errors that arise during migration
   - Prioritize components by complexity (start with simpler components)

4. **Utility Function Migration** ❌
   - Convert utility functions from `.js` to `.ts`
   - Add appropriate type signatures
   - Ensure type safety for all parameters and return values

5. **API and Data Layer Migration** ❌
   - Type API service functions
   - Apply request and response typing
   - Ensure end-to-end type safety for data flow

6. **State Management Migration** ❌
   - Apply types to Redux/state management
   - Ensure actions and reducers are properly typed
   - Create typed selectors for state access

7. **Testing and Verification** ❌
   - Add type checking to test files
   - Ensure all components pass type checking
   - Add strict mode incremental adoption

## Progress Tracking

| Category | Total Items | Completed | In Progress | Not Started |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Setup & Configuration | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Type Definitions | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| Components | TBD | 0 | 0 | TBD |
| Utility Functions | TBD | 0 | 0 | TBD |
| API Layer | TBD | 0 | 0 | TBD |
| State Management | TBD | 0 | 0 | TBD |
| Testing | TBD | 0 | 0 | TBD |

## Type Definitions Created

1. **Core Application Types** - `src/types/app.ts`
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Game library types
   - Performance metrics
   - Application state

2. **Component Types** - `src/types/components.ts`
   - Props interfaces for all UI components
   - Common UI element types

3. **API Types** - `src/types/api.ts`
   - Request and response types for all endpoints
   - Authentication interfaces
   - Game management types
   - Social interactions

4. **State Management Types** - `src/types/state.ts`
   - Redux state interface definitions
   - Action types and creators
   - State selectors

5. **Utility Types** - `src/types/index.ts`
   - Common utility types
   - Type helpers and transformers

## Next Steps

- [ ] Audit the codebase to identify all files requiring migration
- [ ] Start converting simple utility functions to TypeScript
- [ ] Begin migrating simpler components to TypeScript
- [ ] Update build scripts to correctly handle TypeScript compilation

## Best Practices

1. Use interfaces for object shapes that will be implemented or extended
2. Use type aliases for unions, primitives, and complex types
3. Avoid using `any` type wherever possible
4. Prefer using type inference when types are obvious
5. Use explicit return types for exported functions
6. Use generics for reusable components and utilities
7. Keep type definitions DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
8. Separate types into logical files by domain
9. Use intersection types (`&`) and union types (`|`) to build complex types
