## CSS Organization Improvements

### Variables Consolidation

The CSS variables have been consolidated into a single file for better maintainability:

1. **Consolidated Variables:**
   - Combined `variables.css` and `theme-variables.css` into a single `variables.css` file
   - Removed redundant imports and organized variables logically by purpose
   - Eliminated unnecessary file dependencies

2. **Improved Variable Structure:**
   - Base variables are defined at the root level
   - Content-specific variables are grouped by purpose
   - Theme overrides are properly segregated
   
3. **Benefits:**
   - Simplified dependency chain
   - Reduced CSS load time
   - Better organization of theme variables
   - Easier maintenance with all variables in one location

### Content CSS Modularization

The CSS for content sections has been organized into a modular structure under `src/styles/content/`:

1. **Base Structure:**
   - `/src/styles/content/` - Directory for all content-specific styles
   - `/src/styles/content/index.js` - Entry point that imports all content CSS files

2. **Content CSS Files:**
   - `content.css` - Base styles for content sections (typography, spacing, etc.)
   - `code-blocks.css` - Styles for code blocks, command blocks, and syntax highlighting
   - `guide-sections.css` - Styles for collapsible guide sections and related elements
   - `references.css` - Styles specific to the references page

3. **Theme Integration:**
   - Consolidated all theme variables into the main `variables.css` file
   - Updated both the Dracula and Catppuccin Latte themes with the necessary content-specific variables
   - Ensured consistent styling across both themes
   
4. **CSS Variable Standardization:**
   - Standardized naming scheme for CSS variables
   - Created proper inheritance for theme-specific variables
   - Ensured all components use the appropriate variables for theming

### Component Modularization

The JavaScript components have been refactored into a more modular structure:

1. **Base Structure:**
   - `/src/components/` - Directory for all reusable UI components
   - Each component has its own directory with consistent naming

2. **Component Directory Structure:**
   - `ComponentName/` - Main component directory
   - `ComponentName/index.js` - Exports the component for easy importing
   - `ComponentName/ComponentName.js` - Main component implementation
   - `ComponentName/ComponentName.module.css` - Scoped CSS styles for the component
   - Additional files as needed (utils, subcomponents, etc.)

3. **CSS Module Integration:**
   - Each component has its own CSS module to prevent style conflicts
   - Component-specific styles are scoped to the component
   - Global styles are kept in the main CSS files

4. **Testing Structure:**
   - `/src/test/components/` - Directory for component unit tests
   - Each component has a corresponding test file (`ComponentName.test.js`)

5. **Script Utilities:**
   - `/scripts/create-component.js` - Script to generate new component files
   - `/scripts/run-tests.sh` - Script to run component tests

### Benefits:

- **Improved organization:** Styles and components are grouped by their purpose, making it easier to find and update specific styles and functionality
- **Reduced specificity issues:** Separating content styles from component styles avoids CSS specificity conflicts
- **Improved maintainability:** Each file has a clear, focused purpose, making it easier to maintain and extend
- **Consistent styling:** Common styles are defined in the base file, ensuring consistency across different content sections
- **Better theme support:** All content elements now properly respond to theme changes
- **Simplified structure:** Fewer files to manage with the consolidated variables approach
- **Easier testing:** Component-specific tests improve code quality and reliability
- **Streamlined development:** Utilities for creating new components reduce boilerplate code
