# SECTION I: GETTING STARTED
> **ROOT ACCESS, RETAINING APPS BETWEEN UPDATES, TRUST ISSUES, PACMAN & YAY**
### ■ SET ADMIN/ [SUDO](https://github.com/bluntwizard/steam_deck_dub_edition/main/README.md#:~:text=DISCRIPTION-,SUDO,-%5BALSO%20KNOWN%20AS) PASSWORD WITHIN KONSOLE/ TERMINAL EMULATOR.
###### COPY/ PASTE
```sh
passwd
```
```sh
ENTER NEW ADMIN PASSWORD
```
# RWFUS: READ-WRITE OVERLAY FILESYSTEM
> **RWFUS COVERS THE /usr/ DIRECTORY [AND SOME OTHERS] ALLOWING PACMAN TO BE INITIALIZED WITHOUT LOSING PACKAGES WHEN THE NEXT UPDATE COMES OUT.**

### ■ INSTALLING BUILD DEPENDENCIES
>**DOWNLOAD, POPULATE, & REFRESH KEYS FROM UBUNTU'S KEYSERVER.**
> 
>**[GCC/ CLANG/ GLIBC/ MAKE - MAY BE REDUNDANT.]**

###### COPY/ PASTE
```sh
sudo echo "keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com" >> /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf && sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate && sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys && sudo pacman -S base-devel && sudo pacman -S gcc && sudo pacman -S clang && sudo pacman -S make && sudo pacman -S glibc
```
### ■ FIXING TRUST ISSUES
> **THE MAIN ISSUE: PGP KEY VERIFICATION IS BROKEN, FAILING DURING PACKAGE INSTALLATION.**
>
> **THIS IS BECAUSE THE CORE ARCHLINUX-KEYRING IS OUT OF DATE. PACMAN/GNUPG WILL SHOW THAT ANY PACKAGE YOU ARE TRYING TO INSTALL IS OUT OF DATE, CORRUPT, OR OF MARGINAL TRUST.**
>
> **CHANGING REPOS TO OFFICIAL ARCH WOULD FIX THIS, BUT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE KERNEL & OTHER CORE PACKAGES.**
>
> **WE COULD TURN OFF PGP VERIFICATION, BUT THIS IS INSECURE.**
>
> **SO WE MUST MANUALLY INSTALL IT.**

###### COPY/PASTE
```sh
sudo cd Download https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/archlinux-keyring/download && sudo pacman -U archlinux-keyring-20220713-2-any.pkg.tar.zst
